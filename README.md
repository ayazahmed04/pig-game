# Pig Game

## Description

Welcome to the Pig Game! This is a simple dice game where players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating points. The objective is to reach a specific point goal before your opponent.

## Gameplay

1. The game starts with Player 1 rolling the dice.
2. If a player rolls a 1, they lose their turn and all accumulated points for that turn.
3. If a player rolls any other number, that number is added to their current turn score.
4. The player can choose to roll again (risking losing their turn and points) or hold to add their turn score to their total score.
5. The first player to reach the set point goal (e.g., 100 points) wins the game.
